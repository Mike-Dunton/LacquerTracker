                <b>Note: This is still a little buggy, especially with huge spreadsheets! This issue is being looked into.<br></b>
                - My current suggestion is to break up your spreadsheet into smaller lists (max 2,000 rows at a time) and do a little at a time.<br><br><br>
                * Must be a .CSV file<br><br>
                * Must contain a header column with all header titles in lowercase and spelled as shown here.<br><br>
                * Required columns are "name" and "brand"<br><br>
                * Optional columns are "code", "collection", "color", "type", and "indie"<br><br>
                * If using indie column, please use either "yes" or "no" to specify.<br><br>
                * Any information you do not know, leave the cell blank.<br><br>
                * Please be patient when submitting and only hit submit once. It can take up to five minutes to process.<br><br><br><br>
